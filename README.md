# text-analyzer

http://marianogappa.github.io/text-analyzer/

Utility to analyze a text (spanish only).
Aimed at writers who want to review their novels, looking for silly mistakes, repetition etc.
The utility is not really spanish only, but "uncommon words" works for spanish only, and non-latin-non-spanish characterss will not be interpreted properly.

I take PRs! And ideas.
